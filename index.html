        <p>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi (Arabic: عالم فيراري أبوظبي) is a mostly indoors theme park located on Yas Island in
          Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It is the world's first Ferrari-themed park and features Formula Rossa, the
          world's fastest roller coaster.[1]
          The foundation stone for the park was laid on 3 November 2007. Developed by Aldar Properties and constructed
          by BESIX Group subsidiary Six Construct,[2] it took three years to develop the park until it was officially
          opened to the public on 4 November 2010.[3]
          The most recent roller coaster to open is Mission Ferrari, which opened to the public in January 2023.[4]</p>

        <p>As a conclusion to over a decades worth of storytelling, it's got a lot to live up to, and it's about as good
          as you could really hope for it to be. Overall, I really do like Infinity War better. At the end of the day,
          Infinity War was just a wildly new experience, it was such a gamechanger and crowd-pleaser. Not only that,
          Infinity War I think had a better final battle. This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of
          Marvel heroes we've ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at
          Wakanda from Infinity War. Also I hate Professor Hulk, he's just not that fun. Okay so those are my
          criticisms, what did I like about the movie? I guess everything else? The time travel plot let's us revisit
          and honor some old moments in Marvel with a new lens in sort of a Back to the Future Part 2 way that's a lot
          of fun, and it brings back some characters I didn't think we'd ever see again. The movie has a big emotional
          core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful. This movie juggles a lot. Seriously this is like watching
          someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it's a godamn miracle it works at all. That it works this well is even
          more of a miracle. It's an imperfect movie, but perfectly satisfying conclusion to this arc of the Marvel
          saga.</p>

        <p>This movie lived up to its hype. It's possibly one of the best films of its kind, and I especially liked the
          development of all the characters. The villain isn't just a villain. I understood him. Like all Marvel films,
          the visual and aural elements are excellent. Acting and writing are top notch here as well. This film is a bit
          more serious than most Marvel films, which works in its favor.</p>
